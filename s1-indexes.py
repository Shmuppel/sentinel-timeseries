Title : This is Sentinel 1 image processing for calculating indexes in order to find out pooling with radar
Starting Date : 2022/06/13 (Monday)
"""

#                       TO DO
# 1. Find Sentinel-2 cloud free images with clear pooling.
# 2. Clip the water pixel with a `Water Index(es)`.
# 3. Check the same areas/pixes for the dB values.
# 4. Use an average calculation to create `water pixel index` in
#    the following format: min <= value <= max


#               INSTRUCTIONS / PARTS
# Import Sentinel-2 pooling pixels/images/raster

# Select the equivalents for Sentinel-1

# Create a list/table with min-max (dB)

# Calculate and export the indexes
